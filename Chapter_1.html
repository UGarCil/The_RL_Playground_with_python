                    Python is nowadays one of the most widely used and popular programming languages because of its
                    simple syntax, straightforward installation, and the support received from the community. Python has
                    many
                    powerful open
                    source projects that are easy to install and deploy, making it useful for a wide range of areas;
                    from research to digital art.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In recent years, Python has also become a preferred choice for enthusiasts in the area of
                    machine learning, with the production of modules that allow users to download and deploy custom AI
                    pipelines for almost any form of deep learning, including the training of agents capable to learn
                    from their environment and solve tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will begin our course with a general guide on how create simple worlds using the library Pygame.
                    Pygame is a special module that allows for the manipulation of pixels in real time and the
                    integration of user input, making it particularly useful for the creation of games and simple GUIs.
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="row-lg-12 pt-5">
                <img class="img-fluid" src="./images/Chapter_1/0.png" alt="">
            </div>

            <div class="row-lg-12 pt-5">
                <!-- <pre><code>
                def hello_world():
                    print("Hello, world!")
                </code></pre> -->
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the main concerns when people begin their journey with Pygame is that, compared to more
                    formal
                    game engines like Unity, Godot or UnrealEngine, Pygame doesn't have an integrated user interface
                    allowing
                    users to place objects directly in the game. Because everything is done numerically and
                    programmatically, the
                    user often feels discouraged by the overwhelming amount of effort that goes into manually placing
                    objects, even before the actual game rules can be coded.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With the purpose of helping solve this issue, we have created a simple graphic user interface (GUI)
                    for this course. The <b style="font-size:1.2em;">rlpp_designer</b> is a GUI interface that is part
                    of the "Reinforcement Learning with Pygame and Python" library designed for this book (<b
                        style="font-size:1.2em;">rlpp</b>).
                    We will use the designer to facilitate the manual placement of objects in our Pygame window. Once
                    the game objects have been properly configured in space, we can export our project to begin the
                    coding process that applies the rules to our games.

                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a couple of libraries needed, and a Python installation will also be required. As for
                    October 2024, the latest version of Python is 3.12 (we've come a long way!!!).
                </p>


                <p>
                    There are two main ways to install Python in our operative system (Linux, Window or MacOS). A <a
                        href="https://www.python.org/downloads/"> standalone version </a>will install the executable
                    files for Python in your computer, along with some very important libraries that allow Python to
                    communicate with multiple parts of your machine. This form of installing Python is perfect if you
                    will destine your Python applications to only certain types of projects. Examples include:
                <ul class="text-left">
                    <li>Running a server to maintain a website using the library Flask</li>
                    <li>Using Python for simple programs that make use of the default libraries like random, or math
                    </li>
                    <li>Using a particular library, downloaded from the Python Package Index (PyPI) via pip, with the
                        intention of mostly using Python for the application(s) that require such library (or libraries)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The issue with a standalone installation is that over time, some libraries can go out of date
                    (once Python installs them, libraries are not automatically updated). As the field moves forward,
                    new libraries are released that require the same library you already have, but in a higher version!
                </p>
                <p>
                    But why is this a problem? While most of the time the libraries don't conflict each other, sometimes
                    they do, and you would need to decide which project will be sacrificed and will no longer be able to
                    run in your machine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While several solutions exist for this conundrum, the most widely adopted technique is to
                    encapsulate your versions of Python into what is known as an environment. An environment is a bubble
                    that keeps the packages enclosed with all libraries at a specific version. While it is possible (and
                    advisable) to make use of Python venv, we recommend the use of a more sophisticated environment
                    manager called Anaconda.
                </p>
                <h1 class="text-center">Installing Anaconda</h1>
                <p>
                    Anaconda comes in two versions: conda and miniconda. The difference, as the name may suggest, is
                    related to the amount of space in the computer the final installation will take. While conda
                    installs over 1,000 libraries along with Python (conda is often used in computer science), miniconda
                    only installs the basic stuff. For traditional desktops like laptops and workstations, conda is
                    often the way to go, simply because there are less libraries to install from the beginning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To install conda, you can access the oficial <a
                        href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/success">Anaconda Distribution's website</a>.
                </p>
                <img src="./images/Chapter_1/1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
                <p>
                    Once you download the executables required for your operative system, you can open the installer. By
                    doing so, the program will define a path in your computer to download the files, and it will provide
                    options for the type of permissions that Anaconda (and Python) will have from there on.
                </p>
                <div class="text-center">
                    <img src="./images/Chapter_1/2.png" style="width: 40%; height: auto;" class="img-fluid text-center"
                        alt="">
                </div>
                <p>
                    One of the most important elements in this menu is the option <b>Register Anaconda3 as the system
                        Python 3.12</b>. Enabling this box will make the installation of Python in coding editors
                    easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With your installation complete, it's time to use Anaconda for the first time. You can interact with
                    Anaconda with a Terminal window. The Terminal window is another view of your computer that relies
                    only
                    in text ASCII input, and represents the backend, or raw view, of your operative system. While some
                    tasks are not as enjoyable to do only by typing commands into a black screen, a Terminal is
                    essential when working with programming languages and changing things in our machine
                    programmatically (using computer logic).
                </p>
                <p>
                    But wait! It could be dangerous giving Anaconda complete access to the Terminal window because it
                    could override other versions of Python that are needed by other programs to run (even if such
                    programs don't seem to have anything to do with Python). One of the biggest examples is the
                    rendering and 3D modeling software Blender, which requires Python 3 to run.
                </p>
                <img src="./images/Chapter_1/3.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
                <p>
                    Instead of using the Terminal Window directly, Anaconda installs a special version of Terminal
                    called the Anaconda Prompt. In this window you will notice the following line:
                <pre><code>
                (base) C:\Users\MyUserName
                </code></pre>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here, (base) represents the current <b style="font-size: 1.2em;">environment</b> we're in. This
                    means we have access to a particular version of Python (3.12 if Anaconda was installed late in the
                    year 2024) and many libraries associated with it. To get access to the libraries installed in the
                    based environment, we can run:
                </p>

                <pre><code>
                    conda list
                    </code></pre>

                <div class="text-center">
                    <img src="./images/Chapter_1/4.png" class="img-fluid" style="width: 50%;height: auto;" alt="">
                </div>

                <p>
                    Here we can see the list of libraries that are associated with our environment <b>base</b>. However,
                    the library Pygame is not in the list by default, and that provides an opportunity to generate our
                    first environment.
                </p>

                <h1 class="text-center">Creating an environment that contains Pygame</h1>

                <p>
                    As previously mentioned, Pygame is a special library that allows the user to create game-like
                    applications. To create our first environment we can open the Anaconda prompt terminal and type:
                <pre><code>
                        conda create --name pygame_env python=3.9
                        </code></pre>

                The program will then connect with the Anaconda repository via internet to find the package to install
                (Python) at the desired version (3.9), at which point it will then ask for confirmation on whether to
                install the packages found, asking us to type <b>y</b>. Instead of base, the name of our new environment
                will be <b>pygame_env</b> .
                </p>
                <div class="text-center">
                    <img src="./images/Chapter_1/5.png" class="img-fluid" style="width: 60%;height: auto;" alt="">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Once the new environment has been created, we can activate it with the command:

                <pre><code>
                        conda activate pygame_env
                        </code></pre>
                </p>
                <div class="text-center mb-5">
                    <img src="./images/Chapter_1/11.png" class="img-fluid" style="width: 30%;height: auto;" alt="">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Notice the (base) has been replaced for the name of our new environment (pygame_env). This is
                    important and is letting us know we are using and modifying that specific version of Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next step is to install the Pygame library. The good news is that the rlpp library will install
                    it for you along with the GUI rlpp_designer. Although the rlpp library can't be found by Anaconda,
                    we can
                    easily install it
                    using the official Python's package installer (pip):
                </p>

                <pre><code>
                        pip install rlpp==0.4.2
                        </code></pre>
                </p>

                <div class="text-center mb-5">
                    <img src="./images/Chapter_1/12.png" class="img-fluid" style="width: 80%;height: auto;" alt="">
                </div>


                <p>
                    The <b>Reinforcement Learning with Pygame and Python</b> package will install the libraries
                    Pygame, and pyQt5, which it requires to run smoothly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once rlpp is installed, you can prompt the <b>rlpp_designer</b> by simply typing its name in the
                    terminal,
                    as long as you are in the environment that contains the installation for rlpp:
                <pre><code>
                    rlpp_designer
                    </code></pre>
                </p>
                <div class="text-center mb-5">
                    <img src="./images/Chapter_1/13.png" class="img-fluid" style="width: 80%;height: auto;" alt="">
                </div>

                <h1 class="text-center">We will need a code editor</h1>
                <p>
                    We can modify our Python code using an IDE (Integrated Development Editor). Being integrated means
                    there will be a button in our window connecting our Python code with the Interpreter (the actual
                    component that runs the code).
                </p>
                <p>
                    While many editors exist, we suggest using vscode because of it lightweight and popularity in the
                    community of programmers. VsCode also integrates Anaconda environments quite easily and supports the
                    integration of additional programming languages. You can find the installer for vscode that best
                    matches your OS <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">here</a>.
                </p>
                <div class="text-center mb-5">
                    <img src="./images/Chapter_1/14.png" class="img-fluid" style="width: 80%;height: auto;" alt="">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Once vscode is installed in your device, we need to somehow connect it with the Python interpreter.
                    Actually, it would be great to connect the editor with <b>all of the interpreters found across our
                        Anaconda environments</b>. To achieve this, look at the diagram below:
                </p>
                <div class="text-center mb-5">
                    <img src="./images/Chapter_1/15.png" class="img-fluid" style="width: 80%;height: auto;" alt="">
                </div>
                <p>
                    The arrow (A) indicates the "Run" button. If you see it, it means vscode is successfully linked to
                    Anaconda.<br>
                    Otherwise, you can enable it by installing the extension for Python (B), which can be found after
                    typing Python in the search box of the <b>Extensions</b> button (C).
                </p>

                <h1 class="text-center">One last thing before we begin...</h1>
                <p>
                    We are almost ready to begin our journey! Congratulations if you made it this far in the
                    installation process. Installations and compatibility across programs and platforms is an area where
                    computer specialists spend a lot of time and it's certainly not always fun. However, if we want to
                    train artificial intelligence, we need a
                    special library. Python has become one (or the most) widely used programming language for AI
                    enthusiasts
                    because of the libraries pytorch and tensorflow, and because most research groups that come up with
                    innovation in the field of AI make their projects open source and available via one of these two
                    packages.

                    In this book we will focus our efforts on training agents using pytorch. there is no real difference
                    between pytorch and tensorflow other than the initial preference that quickly turns into a habit.

                    To install pytorch we need to go to the <a href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/"> official
                        documentation page</a>, where we will need to select the best configuration for our computer.

                    if you are lucky enough to have an NVIDIA gpu you can select the cuda version for it. The CUDA
                    software
                    refers to the software that wraps around the GPU to enable users to access it via a suite of
                    packages
                    located in the CUDA-toolkit. By installing these components we will have the power to change the
                    normal
                    behavior of a gpu, which normally works only with graphics, to also train neural networks.

                    The right CUDA version to choose depends greatly on the model and the year in which your device was
                    released, and you can look into the official <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus"> GPU
                        Compute Capability specs</a> provided by NVIDIA. As a general rule for pytorch, install CUDA
                    version
                    11.8 for GPUs below compute capability 7. For most users with GeForce GPUs, commonly installed in
                    gaming
                    laptops, this is the way to go.

                <p>
                    If your device doesn't have an NVIDIA gpu you can still use pytorch, you just need to make sure to
                    select the <b>CPU</b> option
                    instead of CUDA in the Compute Platform option.

                    Once we make our selections, we can copy the command displayed by pytorch in our Anaconda prompt
                    window.
